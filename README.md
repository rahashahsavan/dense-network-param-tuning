# dense-network-param-tuning
A practice project for implementing a simple deep neural network, tuning hyperparameters, and visualizing performance metrics.

# Deep Learning Dense Network Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for training a simple dense (fully connected) neural network using K-Fold cross-validation. It focuses on:

- Practicing implementation of neural networks with PyTorch
- Hyperparameter tuning using randomized search
- Training and evaluation using K-Fold CV
- Plotting training and validation performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- torch
- torchvision
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode and run the cells step by step.

## Dataset
This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification.
